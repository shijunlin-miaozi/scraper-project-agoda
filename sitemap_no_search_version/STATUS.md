# 📌 Project Status — sitemap_no_search Branch

This branch is designed for high-volume, stealthy scraping of Agoda hotel pages without interacting with the search interface. All hotel URLs are sourced directly from Agoda's public sitemaps.


## ✅ Working

- ✅ **Scrapy + Nodriver** for fast, headless scraping
- ✅ **Direct hotel URL input** via CSV (no search interaction)
- ✅ **Data extracted**: hotel name, address, description, facilities, image URLs
- ✅ **Session-based cookie reuse** per proxy with configurable rotation
- ✅ **CAPTCHA detection** with session reset and proxy discard
- ✅ **Failed hotel logging** (CSV) with batch ID, timestamp, reason


## ⚠️ In Progress

- 🧠 **Header generation**: Chrome-only user agents with sec-ch-* validation


## 🚧 Next Steps

- [ ] Simulate browser session warm-up to reduce fingerprint risk
- [ ] Analyze and retry failed hotels via CSV queue


## 🧪 Testing Environment

- 💻 **Machine**: MacBook Air M4
- 🌐 **Proxies**: IP-authenticated residential (Webshare)
- ⚙️ **Execution**: `launch.sh` handles batching, logging, mode toggle
- 📁 **Logs**: Per-batch `.log` files + unified `failed_hotels.csv` log
